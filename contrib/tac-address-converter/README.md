# TAC Address Converter

A simple JS script to convert between TAC <> EVM addresses deterministically, for example `0x123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef012345678` will always result to `tac1zg69v7y6hn00qy352euf40x77qfrg4nchk34lw` and vice versa.

## Usage

1. Replace `ADDRESS` with the address you want to convert in `index.ts`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`
